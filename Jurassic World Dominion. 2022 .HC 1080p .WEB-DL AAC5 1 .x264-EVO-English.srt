BERING SEA
80 MILES WEST OF ALASKA

00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:25,100
DINOSAURS IN OUR WORLD

4
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:27,194
<i>Dinosaurs are in our world.</i>

5
00:01:27,526 --> 00:01:32,188
<i>And with every confrontation we learn
more about this frightening new reality.</i>

6
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,119
<i>How did we get here?</i>

7
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:41,113
<i>It's been three decades
since the deadly events of Jurassic Park,</i>

8
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:45,117
<i>and we've yet to find a way
for these animals to live safely among us.</i>

9
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,116
<i>After the devastating eruption
of Isla Nublar's long dormant volcano,</i>

10
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:52,126
<i>those who survived
were transported to the mainland.</i>

11
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:55,126
<i>Many of the larger predators
were captured,</i>

12
00:01:55,324 --> 00:02:00,129
<i>but the remaining creatures
scattered here, in Big Rock National Park.</i>

13
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:03,922
<i>While most remained in the wild,
those who made their way to civilization</i>

14
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:06,222
<i>struggled to adapt
to unfamiliar conditions.</i>

15
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,009
<i>Local authorities have warned,
the animals are unpredictable,</i>

16
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:12,683
<i>and when hungry, extremely violent.</i>

17
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:18,146
<i>As the dinosaurs spread across boarders,
a global black market has risen.</i>

18
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:21,155
<i>Scorn, you suck pathetic loser!</i>

19
00:02:21,452 --> 00:02:24,044
<i>To combat the growing threat
of illegal poachers</i>

20
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,809
<i>the US Congress awarded sole
collection rights to the global giant -</i>

21
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:29,493
<i>Biosyn Genetics.</i>

22
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:32,513
<i>At Biosyn, we're dedicated to the idea</i>

23
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:36,178
<i>that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.</i>

24
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:42,176
<i>CEO Lewis Dodgson has created
a sanctuary in Italy's Dolomite Mountains</i>

25
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:45,095
<i>where he hopes to study
the dinosaurs ancient immune system</i>

26
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:47,471
<i>for unique pharmaceutical properties.</i>

27
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:51,232
<i>While Biosyn believes we can handle
genetic power responsibly,</i>

28
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,192
<i>the public remains skeptical.</i>

29
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:55,587
<i>Some note that these government contracts</i>

30
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:59,186
<i>have led to massive spikes
in Biosyn's profits.</i>

31
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:03,425
<i>And rumors persist of a human clone
who mysteriously disappeared</i>

32
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,226
<i>leading to a world's wide search.</i>

33
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,969
<i>Some believe she's genetically identical
to Charlotte Lockwood,</i>

34
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:12,214
<i>deceased daughter of Jurassic Park
co-founder Benjamin Lockwood.</i>

35
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:16,192
<i>Now that we brought these animals
back from extinction,</i>

36
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:18,138
<i>can we face the consequences?</i>

37
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:20,277
<i>Are we responsible for them,</i>

38
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:22,350
<i>or should they be left
to fend for themselves?</i>

39
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:28,225
<i>As we adapt to an ever-changing world,
we must find answers to these questions.</i>

40
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:33,308
<i>For their safety as well as for our own.</i>

41
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,787
SAW RIDGE CATTLE CO.
NEVADA

42
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:16,274
We are inside
the illegal breeding facility.

43
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:23,454
The juveniles are kept in cages
to keep cost down. It's medieval.

44
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:28,356
Claire.

45
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:35,073
Why do you think he's separated
from the rest?

46
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:39,385
I don't think he's gonna make it.

47
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:47,294
No. What are you doing? We report this.

48
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:52,381
The DFW takes days to investigate.
We can save this one now.

49
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,767
It's all good. It's all good, buddy.

50
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:00,397
Okay, here we go.

51
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,397
Nope. No!

52
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:10,615
-The head.
-Yeah.

53
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:12,476
Okay, yeah.

54
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:18,127
Okay, come on, let's go.

55
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:24,856
-Hold on!
-To what?

56
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:39,434
TRESPASSING
KEEP OUT

57
00:05:48,953 --> 00:05:51,081
Claire, we're gonna get shot!

58
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:58,453
No, Back, no!

59
00:06:08,342 --> 00:06:09,671
Oh, shit!

60
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:16,465
-Everybody good?
-No!

61
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,619
Okay, so I think we get this one
to the DFW, and then we hit them again.

62
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:34,775
Yeah, you saw that breeding ground, right?

63
00:06:35,548 --> 00:06:36,844
We're done.

64
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:41,035
I got a call last week. It's a real job.

65
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:44,564
Something I can do to effectively
change things. I gotta take it.

66
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:45,781
They need us.

67
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:48,462
Are you saving these dinosaurs
because they need us

68
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:50,891
or are you saving them
to absolve yourself?

69
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:53,372
-Claire.
-I mean this is crazy.

70
00:06:54,134 --> 00:06:57,420
Claire, you're doing the right thing.

71
00:06:57,503 --> 00:07:00,842
But this isn't a way
to go about it anymore.

72
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:05,152
Honestly you need someone
who's good at being shot at.

73
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:08,435
Aren't you and Owen
still like a weird thing?

74
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:12,437
-It's not that weird.
-He didn't mean "weird." No.

75
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,528
He meant, like "surprising."

76
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,546
SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS

77
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,942
Let's bring them home!

78
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,642
Okay, come here.

79
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:05,759
Okay.

80
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,647
We're gonna get you someplace safe.

81
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:33,675
Here you go. Here you go.

82
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:35,292
Hey!

83
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:40,256
-Where have you been?
-Nowhere.

84
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,244
-What are you burning?
-Nothing. Just some old blankets.

85
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:49,512
You sure you didn't go past the bridge?

86
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:51,748
That's the look you give me
when you think I'm lying.

87
00:12:51,832 --> 00:12:53,032
-Are you?
-No.

88
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:55,386
Maisie, you're literally
looking everywhere but here.

89
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,208
I said I didn't go past the bridge.

90
00:13:01,873 --> 00:13:04,615
Maisie, can we start over?

91
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:07,794
I know, Claire, there are people out there
who would do anything to find me.

92
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:11,369
I'm not angry, that means
you don't have to be angry.

93
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:12,495
I'm not angry.

94
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,439
-I can take care of myself.
-Hey!

95
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:19,809
It's okay for us to depend on each other.
That's what people do.

96
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:22,033
How would I know what people do?

97
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:26,162
The only people I've spoken to
in the past four years are you both.

98
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:30,539
Besides, I'm not even a real person anyway.

99
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,741
What?

100
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:35,757
I was made from someone else. I'm not me.

101
00:13:43,187 --> 00:13:46,016
You're the only you who ever was.

102
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:51,944
What? What that, like really corny?

103
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:53,035
It was so corny.

104
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:56,111
-Can we keep that between us?
-Can't promise that.

105
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:04,949
-Hey, kid. Sorry I'm late.
-Hi.

106
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,065
You smell like horses.

107
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:14,532
-Oh, you like that, do you?
-I do. Yeah.

108
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:15,517
Okay.

109
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:19,883
I'm gonna make dinner.

110
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:22,055
Everything okay?

111
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:24,443
She went into town again.

112
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,441
Oh, this kid...
Did you talk to her?

113
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:31,290
I tried.

114
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:34,969
I'll talk to her.

115
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:19,068
Cut away from yourself.

116
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:27,325
-Stone cold.
-Right?

117
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,851
-I would not mess with her.
-No way.

118
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:39,468
Listen, kiddo, we should probably talk
about you going into town.

119
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:42,868
I don't think you understand
how bad it is being trapped here.

120
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,837
You're not trapped here,
we just don't trust people.

121
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:49,806
No, you just don't trust me.
And then you expect me to trust you.

122
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:52,564
-Why can't I have any freedom?
-Because you can't.

123
00:16:57,971 --> 00:17:00,664
-That went great.
-What is happening?

124
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,217
-She's 14.
-Yeah.

125
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:05,942
You remember what that was like.

126
00:17:06,783 --> 00:17:08,260
I do.

127
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:11,929
We can't keep her here forever.

128
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:15,442
If we don't figure this out she's gonna go
a lot further than the bridge.

129
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:17,319
If they find her
we never gonna see her again.

130
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,963
We gotta protect her. That's our job.
That's what we are gonna do.

131
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:23,125
Protect her how? By locking her inside?

132
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,497
<i>She's got questions.</i>

133
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:30,526
<i>You know, questions we can't answer.</i>

134
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:34,002
<i>She wants to know who she is.</i>

135
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,952
<i>Who Charlotte Lockwood was.</i>

136
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:46,479
Tracked Grady to his house.

137
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,323
You were right.

138
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:50,492
Raptor's got a juvenile.

139
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:53,959
But listen, there's something else.

140
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,133
I found that girl you've been after.

141
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,971
WEST TEXAS

142
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:27,965
Thanks for coming.

143
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:30,049
Wasn't sure whom to call.

144
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:33,313
They said Wildlife didn't even want
to see it if it wasn't a dinosaur.

145
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:35,860
Yeah, well, they get all the attention.

146
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,215
You guy wanna vary the sampling plots
a 100 yards each.

147
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,982
-These are your students?
-Yeah.

148
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:44,877
We've been looking into the impact
of industrial farming on the environment.

149
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:46,949
So, this is right up our alley.

150
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:51,993
They hit 60 fields in the county.
You seen anything like this before?

151
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,049
No, not like this.

152
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,006
They've been leaving degrading fields
all across the Midwest.

153
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,066
First, these big companies
try to kill off all the insects.

154
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,981
Now this.

155
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:14,239
Is that your land?

156
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:17,541
That's the Bennetts corn.
The locust didn't eat that.

157
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:20,119
-You plant the same seed as the Bennetts?
-No.

158
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,943
We are independent.

159
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:26,346
They use Biosyn seed.

160
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:30,231
Yeah, I bet they do.

161
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:33,232
You say you caught a live one?

162
00:20:35,172 --> 00:20:37,952
UTAH

163
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:45,031
Okay, let it out slow.

164
00:20:46,658 --> 00:20:47,919
-Got it?
-Yeah.

165
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:49,900
Easy!

166
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:58,160
Why do we dig?

167
00:20:58,244 --> 00:21:03,613
Because paleontology is science,
and science is about the truth.

168
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:05,980
And there is truth in these rocks.

169
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:07,493
Grant!

170
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,340
You gonna wanna see this.

171
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,260
Ellie Sattler.

172
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:28,097
Alan Grant.

173
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:30,501
You look the same.

174
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:35,486
And this place is so...

175
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,528
So... you.

176
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:43,742
I'm sorry. If I'd known
you were coming I would...

177
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:52,159
Can I get you something? A bear? Or...

178
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:57,114
Maybe not at 10 a.m.
But, ice tea?

179
00:21:57,197 --> 00:21:59,885
Tea, yeah! Tea, I can do that.

180
00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:04,137
Saw a lot of tourists on the way in.

181
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:06,586
All the funding dried up, so...

182
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:09,138
Somebody's gotta pay for all of this.

183
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:10,788
Thank you.

184
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:17,860
I read your articles about soil science
and regenerative farming. It was great.

185
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,137
Thanks.

186
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:21,090
Could be grounds for some hope
for a change.

187
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:23,261
How are your kids?

188
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:27,777
Amazing. Grown, it's shocking.

189
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:30,151
They're both in college,
can you believe that?

190
00:22:30,235 --> 00:22:31,633
And Mark?

191
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:35,244
It's over.

192
00:22:38,843 --> 00:22:40,167
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

193
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:44,635
It's okay. I'm back to me, and my work.

194
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,159
And now it's...

195
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:48,676
-That's great.
-That's good. It is.

196
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,169
I'm alone at last.

197
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,843
Exciting times.

198
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:54,490
Yeah, I'm living that Alan Grant life.

199
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,152
-It's just...
-Can be lonely.

200
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:57,427
So free.

201
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:01,846
Ellie...

202
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:07,376
You didn't come out all this way
just to catch up now, did you?

203
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:15,830
It's a locust.
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but...

204
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:18,619
God, the size of it is massive.

205
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,212
It has genes that had been extinct
since the Cretaceous.

206
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:27,044
And swarms of them are decimating
crops from Iowa to Texas.

207
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:29,296
Terrifying, right?

208
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,727
Started as a few hundred.

209
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:34,248
It could be millions
by the end of this summer.

210
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:38,303
If they keep going there will be no grain
to feed chickens, cattle.

211
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:40,558
The entire food chain would collapse.

212
00:23:40,642 --> 00:23:44,318
Well, it's clearly designed,
but why would anyone do that?

213
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:50,113
None of the crops they're eating
are Biosyn seed.

214
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:51,148
Biosyn.

215
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,645
You're saying Biosyn made this?

216
00:23:54,092 --> 00:23:58,240
It would not shock me that they wanna
control the world's food supply.

217
00:23:58,323 --> 00:24:01,612
-Not before a few millions starve.
-Now, what is that saying?

218
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:04,605
"We are three meals away from anarchy."

219
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:07,738
If we don't stop them
you can pick your last three meals.

220
00:24:10,206 --> 00:24:12,288
So, why are you bringing it to me?

221
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:15,712
I need concrete evidence
Biosyn's responsible for all this.

222
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:20,033
I need to go to their sanctuary
and get DNA from another locust there.

223
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:23,359
But I need a witness.

224
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:25,310
Alan...

225
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,620
You command respect. People believe you.

226
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:30,543
Yeah.

227
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:33,787
You know why I'm here?
It's quiet. I'm done with all of that.

228
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:35,372
Are you? Okay.

229
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:41,067
Well, I'm sorry, Alan. Nobody gets
that luxury anymore, not even you.

230
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,464
And you know what?

231
00:24:43,987 --> 00:24:45,815
You are the one I trust.

232
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:53,382
This Biosyn's sanctuary is what,
a hundred miles from anywhere?

233
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:54,787
How would you even get in there?

234
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:58,911
I got an invite
from their in-house philosopher.

235
00:24:59,986 --> 00:25:02,829
Seems there's a lot of money
in being a chaotician these days.

236
00:25:02,913 --> 00:25:06,387
And he just happen to invite you
out of the blue?

237
00:25:07,387 --> 00:25:09,740
He said there were things I'd wanna see.

238
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:17,402
You coming or what?

239
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,540
U.S. WILDLIFE RELOCATION FACILITY
PENNSYLVANIA

240
00:25:24,263 --> 00:25:25,356
Come on!

241
00:25:26,311 --> 00:25:27,584
It's clear!

242
00:25:32,404 --> 00:25:35,007
Every animal captured on the mainland
comes through here

243
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:37,796
before shipping out
to Biosyn's sanctuary in Dolomites.

244
00:25:37,897 --> 00:25:41,339
We give them the medical attention
and make sure they live healthy.

245
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:44,666
-So much security.
-Those are just the ones you see.

246
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:47,309
A lot of shady types out there
want these guys.

247
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:51,204
Your plane is just fueling up.

248
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:55,225
Biosyn's a tough invite,
you guys must know somebody.

249
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:56,833
-Do you mind if I...
-Of course.

250
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:00,333
Hi there.

251
00:26:02,455 --> 00:26:03,646
Follow me.

252
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,322
We rescued these guys from an illegal
breeding farm in Nevada a few weeks ago.

253
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:10,452
Shut the whole place down. Anonymous tip.

254
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:14,461
Good girl. Yes, yes.

255
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:19,383
Alan, you never get used to it.

256
00:26:20,368 --> 00:26:21,783
-Take care. Thank you.
- Bye.

257
00:26:59,793 --> 00:27:00,992
Hey.

258
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:04,686
You look just like Blue.

259
00:27:05,655 --> 00:27:07,137
Is she your mother?

260
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,491
This? You wanna try it?

261
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:13,253
Okay.

262
00:27:28,453 --> 00:27:30,348
Maisie, don't move..

263
00:27:33,273 --> 00:27:36,535
Hey, girl. Staying out of trouble?

264
00:27:37,535 --> 00:27:39,417
She had a baby. That's impossible.

265
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:44,874
-Back up.
-She won't hurt us, right?

266
00:27:44,969 --> 00:27:47,414
Oh, you damn right she will. Just breathe.

267
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:49,471
If you don't she'll think you're scared.

268
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:50,785
I am scared.

269
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:53,855
She doesn't need to know that.

270
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,534
Her nest has got to be nearby.
Maisie get inside.

271
00:28:04,618 --> 00:28:06,632
-I'm coming with you.
-What did I just say?

272
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:19,611
-We gotta move.
<i>- Not yet, we need the girl.</i>

273
00:28:21,918 --> 00:28:23,591
Hey, what's up?

274
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:28,318
Maisie?

275
00:28:29,146 --> 00:28:30,594
Maisie?

276
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,059
Where are you going?

277
00:28:38,143 --> 00:28:40,114
You can't keep me here,
you're not my mother.

278
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:47,965
She's leaving the house.

279
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:16,471
-Time to go!
-Come on let's go!

280
00:29:42,661 --> 00:29:44,193
Who are you?

281
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:06,582
Claire!

282
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:08,200
They found her.

283
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:09,732
What? Who are they?

284
00:30:09,816 --> 00:30:12,233
Poachers, I've seen them around.

285
00:30:12,317 --> 00:30:13,656
Leader's a real shit heel.

286
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:15,953
He must have recognized me,
followed me here.

287
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,137
-Where is she?
-Go get the truck.

288
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:19,418
Oh, my God.

289
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,082
Owen!

290
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,541
Hey! No.

291
00:30:34,202 --> 00:30:36,274
They took her kid too.

292
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:43,368
I am gonna get her back.
I promise you that.

293
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:56,449
Come on. I know whom to call.

294

295
00:31:15,935 --> 00:31:17,686
This year, man. What's next?

296
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,277
Historically? Darkness, blood,
reign of fire.

297
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:22,381
I think frogs.

298
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,433
We're not gonna be around
for much longer anyway.

299
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:26,369
These locusts in Nebraska
are about to wrap it up.

300
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:27,601
They're in the corn, wheat.

301
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,791
Basically whole of our food
and our food's food, so...

302
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:31,186
We can say goodbye to this.

303
00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:37,765
-Hello?
<i>- Franklin, it's me. You're at work?</i>

304
00:31:38,503 --> 00:31:40,315
You're kinda subject of interest
around here,

305
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,122
so I can't really be talking to you.

306
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:44,824
<i>Come, on, I'm in trouble.
I really need your help. Please.</i>

307
00:31:44,908 --> 00:31:46,123
Yeah, and I could lose my job,

308
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:48,221
and you know I'm not qualified
to do anything else.

309
00:31:48,305 --> 00:31:49,454
<i>We're outside.</i>

310
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:53,038
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

311
00:31:56,997 --> 00:31:59,042
-Is that him?
-That's him.

312
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:02,800
Name's Rainn Delacourt.
A real piece of work.

313
00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:04,593
What did he take?

314
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,352
Something we care about very much.

315
00:32:08,146 --> 00:32:11,228
Oh, shit. I told you somebody
would come looking for her.

316
00:32:11,313 --> 00:32:12,880
You can't just take a person, Claire.

317
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,936
-I had no choice.
-Not in the eyes of the law.

318
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,894
This guy is not the "law."
Tell us how to find him.

319
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,605
What did you guys call me from?

320
00:32:23,323 --> 00:32:25,751
We have a man on the inside
of Delacourt's operation.

321
00:32:25,835 --> 00:32:28,411
There's an exchange in Malta
sometime tomorrow, cash for cargo.

322
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:30,095
Is she with him?

323
00:32:30,593 --> 00:32:34,324
There's no mention, but we have people
on the ground already.

324
00:32:34,424 --> 00:32:35,346
One of them you know.

325
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,307
A lot of us got recruited by the CIA
after the Park went down.

326
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:41,856
Barry's French intelligence now.

327
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:47,010
-I need to talk to him.
-You can't just call him. He's deep cover.

328
00:32:47,228 --> 00:32:49,071
Look, once we make the bust in Malta

329
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:51,160
our guys will see if Delacourt knows
where she is.

330
00:32:51,645 --> 00:32:53,927
Our guys, not you.

331
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,668
Promise me you won't go in there
with your vest and mess everything up.

332
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:00,944
Why would I do that?

333
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:05,043
Look, you guys are both crazy.

334
00:33:05,927 --> 00:33:09,037
But you seem like you're good parents,
or whatever you're trying to be.

335
00:33:09,536 --> 00:33:10,657
She's lucky to have you.

336
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:14,393
Don't get killed, okay?

337
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,306
I think we're almost there.

338
00:33:35,462 --> 00:33:36,336
Yeah.

341
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:54,137
Oh, hey.

342
00:33:54,221 --> 00:33:56,513
I have to warn you,
everyone is so excited to have you.

343
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:59,181
You guys are absolute legends around here.

344
00:33:59,594 --> 00:34:01,964
You must be confusing us
with somebody else.

345
00:34:02,078 --> 00:34:05,598
You know, It's great that you guys
are still so close to Dr. Malcolm.

346
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:07,921
Sometimes you meet your heroes
and they disappoint you,

347
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:10,496
but he's exactly the way
you'd want him to be.

348
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,658
Such motility of thought, it's incredible.

349
00:34:12,742 --> 00:34:14,310
How much time did you spend with him?

350
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:19,027
Well, I know that was sarcastic,
but honestly, not enough.

351
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:21,192
Please, after you. And watch your head.

352
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:31,279
So, Biosyn bought this land for the amber
deposits back in the nineties,

353
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:33,167
but we've managed to turn into
a safe haven

354
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:34,978
for about 20 displaced species.

355
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:38,803
The first generation came from Sorna.
Most of the Nublar dinosaurs are here too.

356
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,744
Took Fish and Wildlife three years
to catch the T-Rex.

357
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:44,412
The T-Rex is here?

358
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,367
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

359
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:49,232
Arrived just before you guys.

360
00:35:06,307 --> 00:35:09,162
<i>Aerial deterrent system - active.</i>

361
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:12,330
Restricted aerial space.
Protects the airborne life.

362
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:14,760
Keeps the Pterosaurs below 500 feet.

363
00:35:14,973 --> 00:35:16,128
Airborne?

364
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:20,423
Is that Dreadnoughtus?

365
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:22,145
What?

366
00:35:29,258 --> 00:35:30,660
Beautiful, right?

367
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,744
Her name means "fear nothing."
I guess you know that.

368
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,192
-What do they graze on?
-All thorn and fern.

369
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:41,040
All indigenous, nothing stocked,
except for the deer population.

370
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:43,636
It's a great mesenchyme species
for the apex predator.

371
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,704
-The apex predator?
-Giganotosaurus.

372
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:50,290
At least for now.

373
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,220
You don't let people in there, right?

374
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:08,910
No. Our research outposts
are connected completely underground.

375
00:36:09,008 --> 00:36:11,767
If we have to we can just
herd the animals remotely

376
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:16,154
using neural implant that sends
electrical signals directly to the brain.

377
00:36:16,238 --> 00:36:18,323
Like shocks?

378
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:20,005
No, like signals.

379
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:23,197
Does it strike you as a little bit...

380
00:36:23,304 --> 00:36:24,364
-Cruel?
-Cruel.

381
00:36:25,272 --> 00:36:28,669
Do you know how much voltage was
in the electric fences at Jurassic Park?

382
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,131
Yeah.

383
00:36:36,936 --> 00:36:38,878
<i>Please join Dr. Ian Malcolm at noon</i>

384
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:41,441
<i>in the lecture hall
for the "Ethics of genetic power."

385
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,790
God, everyone's so young.

386
00:36:43,874 --> 00:36:47,111
Well, It is part of our ethos
to track the best and brightest.

387
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,697
Doctors. Respected, renowned.

388
00:36:50,781 --> 00:36:53,509
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant. Hi.

389
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:56,153
Wow, this is big, I'm Lewis.

390
00:36:56,237 --> 00:36:58,267
-Dodgson. Yeah.
-Hi.

391
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,130
-You're Lewis Dodgson?
-I am. How do you do?

392
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:02,032
We didn't expect to actually see you here.

393
00:37:02,116 --> 00:37:04,425
Well, I wouldn't be anywhere else.

394
00:37:04,509 --> 00:37:06,157
-Would you?
-No.

395
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:08,779
I mean, people you see here
are changing the world.

396
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:11,205
Would you mind if we...

397
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:14,089
It would mean a lot if...

398
00:37:14,173 --> 00:37:15,204
Do you wanna...

399
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:17,683
Oh, great. Thank you so much.

400
00:37:18,123 --> 00:37:19,994
That's good. That's good. Thanks.

401
00:37:20,078 --> 00:37:24,301
So, you are going to see
some remarkable things today.

402
00:37:24,801 --> 00:37:28,511
We're unlocking the true power
of the genome.

403
00:37:28,596 --> 00:37:30,013
We're this close, believe me.

404
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,316
-You'll make a fortune off that.
-No, it's not about money.

405
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,899
No, we've already identified
dozens of applications for Paleo DNA.

406
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:40,968
We're talking about cancer,
Alzheimer's, autoimmune.

407
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:42,856
We will be saving lives.

408
00:37:43,437 --> 00:37:44,679
I bet.

409
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:47,883
Anyway, I wish I could take
you around myself, but...

410
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,998
So, you're in more than capable
hands with Ramsay.

411
00:37:52,592 --> 00:37:55,232
He's basically a young me.

412
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:58,905
Only smarter and taller.

413
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:01,274
Do you have food?

414
00:38:02,002 --> 00:38:03,677
-Like, one of my bars?
-Pardon?

415
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:06,327
No, never mind, I'll find something.

416
00:38:06,462 --> 00:38:09,899
So, I wanna do more of this
later on if we...

417
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:14,256
Oh, we booked you on a private pod
for the trip out, so...

418
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,503
It's beautiful. You'll love it.
Through the caverns and everything.

419
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:18,964
You better hurry, Malcolm's on.

420
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:21,194
He's a bit of a contrarian,
but I like him.

421
00:38:21,278 --> 00:38:23,215
He keeps us on our toes.
Anyway...

422
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:25,463
Thank you for being here, it's...

423
00:38:28,278 --> 00:38:30,400
Okay, follow me, please.

424
00:38:32,636 --> 00:38:33,482
What?

425
00:38:33,877 --> 00:38:39,367
Human beings have no more right
to safety or liberty

426
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,453
than any other creature on this planet.

427
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:48,088
We not only lack dominion over nature,

428
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:51,283
we're subordinate to it.

429
00:38:51,968 --> 00:38:56,953
And now here we are, with the opportunity
to rewrite life at our fingertips.

430
00:38:57,037 --> 00:38:58,731
And just like with nuclear power,

431
00:38:58,815 --> 00:39:01,957
nobody knew what to expect
with genetic engineering,

432
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:05,637
but they pressed
the button and hoped for the best.

433
00:39:06,986 --> 00:39:09,408
Just like you are doing now.

434
00:39:10,717 --> 00:39:12,945
Yep, you.

435
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:19,415
You control the future
of our survival on planet Earth.

436
00:39:19,912 --> 00:39:22,285
According to you
the solution is genetic power.

437
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:26,097
But that same power
could devastate the food supply,

438
00:39:26,437 --> 00:39:30,766
create new diseases,
alter the climate even further.

439
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:34,506
Unforeseen consequences occur.

440
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:39,894
And every time. Every single time

441
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,111
we all act surprised.

442
00:39:44,085 --> 00:39:47,848
Because deep down I don't think
that any of us actually believe

443
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:49,834
that these dangers are real.

444
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,456
In order to instigate revolutionary change

445
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:06,548
we must transform human consciousness.

446
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:15,560
Mayam?

447
00:40:17,074 --> 00:40:18,899
Very good. There you go.

448
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,677
I don't want to be rude to my friends.

449
00:40:20,762 --> 00:40:23,237
Catch me on my way out. Thanks everybody.

450
00:40:24,115 --> 00:40:28,563
Look at you. Look at me, and look at you.

451
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:31,008
Whoa, this is so trippy.

452
00:40:31,122 --> 00:40:32,482
You look like you're doing well.

453
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:35,887
Well, I got five kids, you know,
whom I adore more than life itself, so...

454
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:37,656
expenses add up.

455
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:39,690
You? Alan, are you...

456
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,048
You have any family or?

457
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:43,918
No.

458
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,086
-I need to talk to you.
-I need to talk to you too, privately.

459
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:49,913
Do you two talk a lot?

460
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:51,666
He slid into my DMs.

461
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:53,319
-He did what?
-It's urgent, Ian.

462
00:40:53,403 --> 00:40:56,326
-What did you do?
-Seven minutes to midnight stuff.

463
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,917
The doomsday clock might be
about out of time, but as they say,

464
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:03,800
it's always darkest
just before eternal nothingness.

465
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,608
What?

466
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:11,119
Locusts altered with Cretaceous Era DNA--

467
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:12,111
That's not my field.

468
00:41:12,195 --> 00:41:13,862
But if these things continue to multiply

469
00:41:13,946 --> 00:41:16,796
we're talking about cascading
system-wide effects, Ian.

470
00:41:17,194 --> 00:41:21,075
-Gosh, that's a drag.
-What is the matter with you?

471
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:23,211
Why, is there something special
you want me to do?

472
00:41:23,295 --> 00:41:24,988
How about give a damn?

473
00:41:25,098 --> 00:41:29,048
Hey, I gave my opinion robustly for years.

474
00:41:29,132 --> 00:41:32,137
As expected, the sum of our human
endeavors has led to our annihilation.

475
00:41:32,787 --> 00:41:36,296
And the only play now
is to take the time we have left

476
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:39,810
and, you know, just like
we always do, squander it.

477
00:41:39,894 --> 00:41:42,393
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.

478
00:41:42,477 --> 00:41:44,916
Can I offer you guys some joe?

479
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:49,032
Tyler, please, two cappuccinos.

480
00:41:49,116 --> 00:41:50,206
I don't want a cappuccino.

481
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,342
Well, I can do a cortado
or, like, macchiato?

482
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:56,226
Trust me, it's real tough that jet lag,
that's gonna perk you right up.

483
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:03,188
The locusts are a part of a larger project
called Hexapod Allies.

484
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:04,997
You were right about their regiment.

485
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:07,292
I just heard here a rumor six weeks ago.

486
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:09,356
I read your piece
on decadence and put two and two together.

487
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,704
-I was not raising my voice.
-You're beginning to.

488
00:42:11,788 --> 00:42:12,718
It's what you're doing.

489
00:42:12,802 --> 00:42:16,580
They proliferating wildly. They're lasting
three-four times longer than they should.

490
00:42:16,664 --> 00:42:20,509
And all my models are pointing
toward a global ecological collapse, Ian.

491
00:42:20,593 --> 00:42:24,250
Downstairs. Sub-level 6.
That's where they keep the locusts.

492
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,619
Look for a lab marked L4.

493
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:28,581
But wait, how are we ever
gonna get down there?

494
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:31,224
Hey, this looks so silky,
may I touch this blouse?

495
00:42:31,308 --> 00:42:32,181
Sure.

496
00:42:32,265 --> 00:42:34,009
You know what it is? Don't tell me.

497
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,671
-You won't know it.
-This is sustainable bamboo.

498
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:40,197
It is sustainable bamboo,
how did you know that?

499
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:41,191
Yeah, it's amazing.

500
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:43,098
I've got a cumin, I've got cinnamon,

501
00:42:43,182 --> 00:42:45,627
I've got allspice, which is not
very popular. I've got five spice--

502
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:47,970
-Doctor.
-...if you're into that kinda feel.

503
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,185
-Yeah.
-Let's talk milks, okay?

504
00:42:51,432 --> 00:42:53,020
Soy Milk, yes?

505
00:42:54,233 --> 00:42:55,203
No.

506
00:42:55,287 --> 00:42:57,089
What just happened?

507
00:42:57,173 --> 00:42:58,690
We're in.

508
00:43:12,486 --> 00:43:14,729
<i>Sub-level 6. Restricted.</i>

509
00:43:21,504 --> 00:43:23,542
Lewis, you're not listening to me.

510
00:43:23,626 --> 00:43:27,353
The locusts prehistoric DNA has made them
stronger than they should be.

511
00:43:27,456 --> 00:43:30,521
They're multiplying like crazy,
and they're not dying.

512
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,173
-What part of this don't you understand?
-Oh, I do understand.

513
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:37,350
-This is gonna be a global famine.
-Hey, we can't anticipate everything.

514
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:39,439
We need to eradicate the ones we released.

515
00:43:39,523 --> 00:43:41,154
-What?
-All of them.

516
00:43:41,238 --> 00:43:42,551
No. No.

517
00:43:42,635 --> 00:43:46,533
Henry, we don't wanna cause a panic,
we want control.

518
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:48,609
These is no such thing.

519
00:44:01,356 --> 00:44:06,362
When we're afraid what do we do?
What have we done before?

520
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,280
We follow through. That's what we do.

521
00:44:11,363 --> 00:44:12,382
Right?

522
00:44:15,082 --> 00:44:16,098
Right.

523
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:21,936
We found the girl. She's en route.

524
00:44:22,511 --> 00:44:24,303
-Cost me a fortune.
-What?

525
00:44:25,237 --> 00:44:26,321
Wait, you found her?

526
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:28,787
Yeah, found them both.
Her and the little Raptor.

527
00:44:29,695 --> 00:44:31,977
Blue reproduced all on her own.

528
00:44:33,065 --> 00:44:35,554
Just like you said.
You're so smart, Henry.

529
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,028
That's why this works.

530
00:44:39,848 --> 00:44:43,305
You understand the value of these
creatures, you always have. I do too.

531
00:44:43,812 --> 00:44:45,745
And we don't stop because of what,

532
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:47,907
little side project went south?

533
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:49,848
Hey.

534
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:54,339
If they trace the locusts back to us,
they come for the dinosaurs.

535
00:44:54,795 --> 00:44:56,329
All your work gone.

536
00:44:57,217 --> 00:45:00,073
Billions of dollars in assets gone.

537
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,142
Diamonds with no one to mine them.

538
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,432
You really think she's the solution?

539
00:45:10,731 --> 00:45:11,666
Okay.

540
00:45:13,898 --> 00:45:16,399
Everything involving the girl
goes through me, right?

541
00:45:18,288 --> 00:45:19,315
Is she all right?

542
00:45:20,163 --> 00:45:21,362
She better be.

543
00:45:22,713 --> 00:45:25,192
She's the most valuable
intellectual property on the planet.

544
00:45:26,334 --> 00:45:28,356
MALTA

545
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:38,042
-I said I'd call you.
-They land yet?

546
00:45:38,622 --> 00:45:39,899
<i>Second plane is incoming.</i>

547
00:45:39,983 --> 00:45:41,596
Who said anything about the second plane?

548
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,359
We flew them separately,
I'm not taking any chances.

549
00:45:44,774 --> 00:45:46,492
<i>And we'll need payment before delivery.</i>

550
00:45:46,576 --> 00:45:48,663
I didn't like what happened last time.

551
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,353
Okay. Okay.

552
00:45:51,337 --> 00:45:52,776
Just call me when it's done.

553
00:46:02,237 --> 00:46:04,209
You said I was going someplace safe.

554
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:05,804
You are.

555
00:46:13,778 --> 00:46:15,200
Walk to the car.

556
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:16,882
No.

557
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:18,504
It's not a choice.

558
00:46:31,175 --> 00:46:35,130
Fifty grand to fly
one little Raptor. Not bad.

559
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:43,531
What's with the girl?

560
00:46:45,518 --> 00:46:47,062
Not your problem.

561
00:46:55,462 --> 00:46:57,543
Pleasure doing business.

562
00:47:00,909 --> 00:47:02,171
We're ready, let's go.

563
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:10,331
Owen.

564
00:47:15,382 --> 00:47:17,046
Hi, Claire.

565
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:19,380
I thought you would've chosen
a quieter line of work.

566
00:47:19,564 --> 00:47:22,612
I tried, my cousin and I opened a Cafe.
I lasted three weeks.

567
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,474
The way that world is headed
it's hard to look away.

568
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:29,340
Delacourt was hired by Soyona Santos,

569
00:47:29,424 --> 00:47:31,780
a broker in the underground
dinosaur trade.

570
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:33,761
We don't have Intel on his cargo.

571
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:37,761
But once they make an exchange
we'll see what they know about your girl.

572
00:47:37,845 --> 00:47:40,856
You can listen in, but promise me,
you will not make contact.

573
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,068
No.

574
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:45,656
All right. See you soon.

575
00:47:46,183 --> 00:47:48,735
There's a big underground market
for dinosaurs now:

576
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:50,749
Europe, Middle East, Northern Africa.

577
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,872
It all comes through here.

578
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:07,018
Don't look at anyone, don't talk
to anyone. Just try to blend in.

579
00:48:44,086 --> 00:48:45,089
I'm okay.

580
00:48:56,959 --> 00:49:00,656
Still flying for Santos, huh?
You must need money.

581
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,010
What's it to you?

582
00:49:02,093 --> 00:49:03,741
I've got cargo.

583
00:49:04,336 --> 00:49:07,001
A thousand kilos
of dinosaur to Palermo.

584
00:49:07,085 --> 00:49:08,586
I give you two thousand.

585
00:49:09,317 --> 00:49:11,593
Two thousand? How much is there?

586
00:49:21,497 --> 00:49:22,784
You lost?

587
00:49:23,532 --> 00:49:24,840
You're American.

588
00:49:26,323 --> 00:49:27,524
That makes us friends?

589
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,820
Listen, I just got here and--

590
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:32,498
No, that was not an invitation. Here.

591
00:49:34,689 --> 00:49:37,067
A souvenir. Go back to the hotel.

592
00:49:37,151 --> 00:49:39,280
You know, throw some bath salts
in the bath.

593
00:49:39,364 --> 00:49:41,638
This place is not your vibe.

594
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:43,367
Wait.

595
00:49:43,913 --> 00:49:45,620
-Look...
-Claire.

596
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,124
Claire, I know this must feel exotic,

597
00:49:49,215 --> 00:49:53,084
but if you mess with the wrong person
down here you disappear.

598
00:49:53,168 --> 00:49:54,633
You feel me?

599
00:49:54,717 --> 00:49:56,194
Good luck, okay?

600
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:57,267
Wait.

601
00:49:59,962 --> 00:50:01,353
-Wait.
-What is this?

602
00:50:01,444 --> 00:50:03,483
-I need your help.
-I don't know you.

603
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,699
-I'm looking for someone.
-Don't do that.

604
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:07,845
She is all alone. Please.

605
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,530
-Is that your daughter?
-Yes.

606
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:20,087
Sorry, I can't get involved.

607
00:50:39,934 --> 00:50:42,289
-I think I got him.
-Target on the move.

608
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:44,683
That's our undercover agent with him.

609
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,759
Claire, he's headed underground.
You see him?

610
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:49,348
Yeah, I've got him.

611
00:50:50,905 --> 00:50:51,866
All right, let's go.

612
00:50:57,913 --> 00:50:58,827
Hey, how you've been?

613
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,091
<i>All units stay at bullseye position.</i>

614
00:51:02,933 --> 00:51:06,735
<i>This is Bravo 1. Primary target inside.
No sign of the girl.</i>

615
00:51:19,262 --> 00:51:22,339
My people say the Raptor arrived
in good condition.

616
00:51:22,993 --> 00:51:24,833
You boys didn't cuck this up.

617
00:51:25,428 --> 00:51:26,716
Call me amazed.

618
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:30,054
I do have another job for you.
Short, hot money's double.

619
00:51:30,528 --> 00:51:31,542
What's the cargo?

620
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:36,911
Atrociraptors, thoroughbreds.

621
00:51:37,685 --> 00:51:38,784
Trained to kill.

622
00:51:39,044 --> 00:51:39,915
Kill who?

623
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:41,473
Whoever they're told.

624
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:44,920
Laser marks the target, they attach
the scent, don't stop till it's dead.

625
00:51:45,004 --> 00:51:45,877
Inescapable.

626
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:48,333
Those idiots making hybrids
had it all wrong.

627
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:52,084
You can't engineer loyalty,
you have to nurture it.

628
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:54,916
Fifty thousand to fly them to Riyadh.

629
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,706
"In" or "out"?

630
00:51:57,754 --> 00:51:58,655
She's not here.

631
00:52:03,602 --> 00:52:04,765
Where are we going?

632
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:06,687
Almost there.

633
00:52:12,685 --> 00:52:14,030
<i>That's the draft. Let's go!</i>

634
00:52:14,428 --> 00:52:15,719
Everyone's down!

635
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:18,170
-Hands in the air!
-Drop your guns!

636
00:52:18,254 --> 00:52:20,310
Delacourt, on the floor, now!

637
00:52:20,394 --> 00:52:21,611
Get on the ground!

638
00:52:21,695 --> 00:52:23,007
Delacourt, stay with!

639
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:24,205
Shit.

640
00:52:25,832 --> 00:52:27,319
Get that truck out of here!

641
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:28,938
Santos, stay still!

642
00:52:35,981 --> 00:52:37,418
<i>We've lost Delacourt.</i>

643
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:52,398
This is Bravo 1.
The truck approaching the underpass.

644
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,314
Go.

645
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:26,235
The girl. Where is she?
Where did they take her?

646
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,360
-Where is she?
-I don't know!

647
00:54:28,444 --> 00:54:31,829
We handed her off to Santos.
I don't know where they took her after.

648
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,851
Claire, It's Santos, the one in white.

649
00:54:47,935 --> 00:54:48,919
I'll find her.

650
00:54:55,951 --> 00:54:56,812
Hold it.

651
00:54:57,487 --> 00:54:59,710
-Let them out.
-What?

652
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:01,205
You heard me.

653
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:28,493
Damn.

654
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:31,597
Shit.

655
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:47,186
<i>Claire, do you have her?</i>

656
00:56:01,266 --> 00:56:02,340
We had some trouble.

657
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:03,271
What kind?

658
00:56:03,355 --> 00:56:06,503
<i>The parents, Grady and Dearing.
They're here.</i>

659
00:56:10,921 --> 00:56:12,333
Can you take care of it?

660
00:56:12,417 --> 00:56:13,357
Not for free.

661
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:15,935
Well, do it.

662
00:56:30,193 --> 00:56:31,560
Okay, okay. Listen.

663
00:56:46,878 --> 00:56:48,778
You don't use it on people.

664
00:56:48,869 --> 00:56:50,421
Where's my daughter?

665
00:56:50,521 --> 00:56:52,010
She wasn't yours to begin with.

666
00:56:54,501 --> 00:56:55,962
Tell me.

667
00:56:57,698 --> 00:57:00,869
Biosyn. They're taking her to Biosyn.

668
00:57:07,816 --> 00:57:10,298
You missed her. She's gone.

669
00:58:03,023 --> 00:58:04,610
Take my hand. Come on!

670
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:36,479
Hold on tight.

671
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:37,988
What?

672
00:58:49,081 --> 00:58:51,242
Do you remember
how we used to get Raptors in the truck?

673
00:58:51,337 --> 00:58:52,491
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

674
00:58:54,415 --> 00:58:55,652
-You're up.
-No.

675
00:58:57,571 --> 00:58:59,315
The last minute dive roll.

676
00:58:59,399 --> 00:59:00,319
I don't dive roll.

677
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,289
You'll be fine.

678
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:03,584
I never got the timing right.

679
00:59:05,419 --> 00:59:07,687
-Now?
-Any minute. Any minute now.

680
00:59:08,421 --> 00:59:09,278
Now?

681
00:59:09,765 --> 00:59:10,605
No.

682
00:59:12,387 --> 00:59:13,242
Now!

683
00:59:20,842 --> 00:59:22,247
Freeze!

684
00:59:29,113 --> 00:59:31,511
I'll fly us outta here.
Tell me where you wanna be dropped.

685
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:33,573
You ever flown to Biosyn?

686
00:59:34,998 --> 00:59:36,954
<i>Owen, they took her to Biosyn.</i>

687
00:59:37,038 --> 00:59:40,022
<i>There's an airfield on the north side
of the island.</i>

688
00:59:40,106 --> 00:59:42,140
You're under arrest. Stay where you are.

689
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:10,399
Right!

690
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:16,286
Get down!

691
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,268
We made a lot of enemies. We gotta go.

692
01:01:57,352 --> 01:01:58,556
He'll be here.

693
01:02:02,759 --> 01:02:04,278
Out of time. Out of time.

694
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:08,267
There he is.

695
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:12,282
-Pull over.
-That's not how planes work.

696
01:02:12,366 --> 01:02:13,695
sub.T

697
01:02:18,912 --> 01:02:20,291
Open the back.

698
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,635
Come on!

699
01:02:45,379 --> 01:02:47,108
Hold on tight!

700
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,788
Still got it.

701
01:03:37,844 --> 01:03:39,381
Kayla Watts.

702
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:41,291
You're welcome.

703
01:03:42,315 --> 01:03:44,014
You look like you fly for Biosyn.

704
01:03:44,142 --> 01:03:47,289
I'm gonna take that the way you meant it
and not the way it sounded.

705
01:03:47,373 --> 01:03:50,563
I fly for whoever got a bag,
but we'll call this one a favor.

706
01:03:50,647 --> 01:03:52,629
Those don't work. They broke.

707
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:57,065
I'll take y'all to Biosyn
but I can't promise it won't be dangerous.

708
01:03:57,845 --> 01:04:00,565
You're willing to risk your life
for people you've never met?

709
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,305
You wanna ask questions or you wanna ride?

710
01:04:08,286 --> 01:04:09,527
We'll take the ride.

711
01:04:16,862 --> 01:04:21,019
So, this is our Habitat Development Lab.
A lot of exciting discoveries as of late.

712
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,008
We've brought back numerous species
in their purest form.

713
01:04:24,092 --> 01:04:26,674
And I mean complete untouched genomes.

714
01:04:26,758 --> 01:04:28,328
Like Moros intrepidus.

715
01:04:28,412 --> 01:04:29,553
What?

716
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:32,895
Wow.

717
01:04:35,857 --> 01:04:39,817
What about splicing DNA,
you know, creating new species?

718
01:04:39,901 --> 01:04:42,696
No, Dr. Sattler, we don't do that here.

719
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,312
We like to think we're more evolved.

720
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:51,638
Okay, looks like we still have some
time left before your ride.

721
01:04:52,609 --> 01:04:54,947
Would you guys like
to tour the facilities yourselves?

722
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:59,068
I mean, we could?

723
01:04:59,152 --> 01:04:59,996
Yeah, why not.

724
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,366
Great, I'll meet you guys
at the Hyperloop Station 3

725
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,309
in about 30 minutes.

726
01:05:05,394 --> 01:05:07,897
Elevators are down this hall. Not those.

727
01:05:08,563 --> 01:05:10,542
Those lead you down to the sub-levels.

728
01:05:10,633 --> 01:05:13,063
You need special clearance
to get down there.

729
01:05:13,147 --> 01:05:14,042
Thirty minutes.

730
01:05:23,581 --> 01:05:25,449
Here. Take this.

731
01:05:27,784 --> 01:05:29,433
-You're ready?
-Yep.

732
01:05:39,483 --> 01:05:41,683
I'm really sorry
that it had to happen this way.

733
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:44,412
Yep, that's what kidnappers say.

734
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:48,010
Claire should never have hidden you away.

735
01:05:48,094 --> 01:05:50,490
You're way too important, Maisie.

736
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,404
You took her too?

737
01:05:57,409 --> 01:05:58,303
Yeah.

738
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:01,780
We needed her to help us understand you.

739
01:06:06,803 --> 01:06:08,150
Hey, Beta.

740
01:06:10,205 --> 01:06:11,488
You okay?

741
01:06:11,572 --> 01:06:14,307
Did you say Beta? Is that her name?

742
01:06:15,194 --> 01:06:16,583
I gave it to her.

743
01:06:17,196 --> 01:06:18,435
Beta's pretty special.

744
01:06:18,963 --> 01:06:21,771
When we made Blue,
we used Monitor lizard DNA

745
01:06:21,869 --> 01:06:23,538
to fill in the gaps in her genome.

746
01:06:24,467 --> 01:06:27,212
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate.

747
01:06:27,593 --> 01:06:31,431
So, Beta and Blue
are genetically identical.

748
01:06:31,535 --> 01:06:33,668
and that's what they have
in common with you and--

749
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:34,670
Charlotte.

750
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:39,444
What do you know about Charlotte?

751
01:06:39,905 --> 01:06:41,065
She died.

752
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:43,535
A long time ago.

753
01:06:44,549 --> 01:06:46,207
It broke my grandpa's heart.

754
01:06:48,189 --> 01:06:49,911
So, he made me.

755
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:53,312
No, Maisie, actually he didn't.

756
01:06:55,889 --> 01:06:57,632
Charlotte made you.

757
01:07:00,657 --> 01:07:04,225
<i>I'm so excited that everyone see
what we've been doing here.</i>

758
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:08,497
<i>There's new technology being made,
new science, like every day almost.</i>

759
01:07:09,261 --> 01:07:13,023
<i>And it's great to be
in the center of that.</i>

760
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:19,352
Charlotte lived on Site B
with all of us till the storm.

761
01:07:20,729 --> 01:07:22,284
She'd loved dinosaurs.

762
01:07:22,492 --> 01:07:23,902
<i>Charlotte, be careful.</i>

763
01:07:23,986 --> 01:07:24,840
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

764
01:07:24,924 --> 01:07:26,669
She grew up around scientists.

765
01:07:27,923 --> 01:07:29,164
And eventually...

766
01:07:30,973 --> 01:07:32,511
she became one herself.

767
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:34,681
<i>A butterfly flew into my office
this morning.</i>

768
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:38,698
<i>They say tiny things have huge impacts,
and I agree, wholeheartedly.</i>

769
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:40,885
She was brilliant.

770
01:07:43,068 --> 01:07:44,531
In ways that I'll never be.

771
01:07:44,963 --> 01:07:48,533
<i>In a metaphysics of identity,
can a replica truly be the original?</i>

772
01:07:49,186 --> 01:07:50,344
<i>And if it's possible,</i>

773
01:07:51,305 --> 01:07:52,634
<i>what makes it so?</i>

774
01:07:57,621 --> 01:07:59,183
<i>I've lost my pen.</i>

775
01:08:02,482 --> 01:08:04,452
-Is that me?
-Yeah.

776
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:09,903
Just like Blue Charlotte was able
to have a child all by herself.

777
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:14,641
She created you with her own DNA.

778
01:08:15,939 --> 01:08:17,057
So, I do have a mother.

779
01:08:18,112 --> 01:08:20,661
Your grandfather didn't want anyone
to know the truth.

780
01:08:21,406 --> 01:08:22,679
He was protecting her.

781
01:08:23,346 --> 01:08:24,347
And you.

782
01:08:25,324 --> 01:08:26,395
Are we the same?

783
01:08:28,506 --> 01:08:29,521
You were.

784
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:34,294
When you were a baby Charlotte started
to show symptoms of a genetic disorder.

785
01:08:34,929 --> 01:08:36,232
That's how she died.

786
01:08:36,887 --> 01:08:39,100
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.

787
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:42,430
-Do I have it too?
-No.

788
01:08:43,678 --> 01:08:45,596
She changed your DNA.

789
01:08:46,377 --> 01:08:50,605
She altered every cell in your body
to eradicate this disease.

790
01:08:51,135 --> 01:08:54,074
No one on Earth has ever known
how to do that.

791
01:08:54,562 --> 01:08:55,612
She fixed me.

792
01:08:56,219 --> 01:08:59,056
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.

793
01:09:00,878 --> 01:09:03,705
Your DNA could change the world.

794
01:09:04,429 --> 01:09:06,840
And I have to know how she did it.

795
01:09:06,924 --> 01:09:08,717
But I just can't replicate her work.

796
01:09:08,801 --> 01:09:10,518
If I could just study you

797
01:09:10,602 --> 01:09:13,858
and Beta whose DNA
was never changed I could...

798
01:09:16,293 --> 01:09:18,976
fix a terrible mistake that I've made.

799
01:09:19,717 --> 01:09:21,031
What's kind of mistake?

800
01:09:29,418 --> 01:09:31,635
<i>Sub-level 6. Restricted.</i>

801
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:37,925
Thanks for coming.

802
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:44,411
Which lab did Malcolm say?

803
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:45,409
L4.

804
01:09:50,517 --> 01:09:51,538
This is it.

805
01:10:10,944 --> 01:10:14,679
Okay, get in, get the sample, and get out.

806
01:10:14,762 --> 01:10:18,052
And move slow. They could swarm
at even the slightest disturbance.

807
01:10:43,476 --> 01:10:44,901
Orthoptera.

808
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,311
Who weeks.

809
01:10:51,968 --> 01:10:54,696
Fully mature. This one.

810
01:10:57,168 --> 01:10:59,390
Ready? Easy.

811
01:11:03,442 --> 01:11:05,745
Okay, go.

812
01:11:07,724 --> 01:11:08,805
What?

813
01:11:09,753 --> 01:11:11,001
Go get it.

814
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:14,430
I that necessary?

815
01:11:15,144 --> 01:11:16,800
What did you think was gonna happen?

816
01:11:16,884 --> 01:11:20,278
I have to take a sample.
We need concrete evidence. This is it.

817
01:11:20,362 --> 01:11:22,338
Alan, you said there was no time.

818
01:11:22,422 --> 01:11:23,828
Can you get it?

819
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:25,280
Of course I can get it.

820
01:11:26,698 --> 01:11:27,872
Easy.

821
01:11:30,193 --> 01:11:31,334
Watch its legs.

822
01:11:35,047 --> 01:11:36,005
Here we go.

823
01:11:37,986 --> 01:11:39,507
They're still signaling between them.

824
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:41,396
-This is not good, Ellen.
-Almost got it.

825
01:11:44,435 --> 01:11:48,187
How does she remain an asset, Henry,
if you're incriminating both of us

826
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:50,771
by showing her classified things
on the computer?

827
01:11:50,855 --> 01:11:53,878
<i>Charlotte Lockwood believed the methods
we used at Jurassic Park </i>

828
01:11:53,971 --> 01:11:55,362
<i>could cure diseases.</i>

829
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:56,946
<i>She was right.</i>

830
01:11:57,431 --> 01:12:00,856
<i>Having filled the gaps in Maisie's genome
with altered DNA,</i>

831
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:05,067
<i>she used a pathogen to deliver
the repaired sequence to every cell.</i>

832
01:12:05,728 --> 01:12:09,759
<i>If I can re-purpose what she did,
I could change the locusts DNA,</i>

833
01:12:09,843 --> 01:12:12,379
<i>eradicating them in a single generation.</i>

834
01:12:12,473 --> 01:12:15,549
<i>Maisie and the baby Raptor
will provide the missing data.</i>

835
01:12:23,313 --> 01:12:25,073
Hey, you wanna get out of that?

836
01:12:28,967 --> 01:12:30,095
What the..?

837
01:12:31,788 --> 01:12:32,722
Got it.

838
01:12:57,769 --> 01:12:58,944
Maisie!

839
01:13:11,163 --> 01:13:14,183
<i>Asset containment breach.
Please remain in your sessions.</i>

840
01:13:16,303 --> 01:13:18,950
<i>Asset containment breach.
Please remain in your sessions.</i>

841
01:13:23,818 --> 01:13:25,019
Where's the key?

842
01:13:43,468 --> 01:13:44,409
You okay?

843
01:13:45,164 --> 01:13:47,299
Yeah, you?

844
01:13:48,153 --> 01:13:49,150
Yeah.

845
01:13:58,879 --> 01:14:02,801
You are Dr. Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant.

846
01:14:03,474 --> 01:14:04,983
You were at Jurassic Park.

847
01:14:06,217 --> 01:14:08,055
What are you doing here?

848
01:14:10,394 --> 01:14:11,702
What are you doing here?

849
01:14:14,063 --> 01:14:15,720
My name is Maisie Lockwood.

850
01:14:17,038 --> 01:14:19,238
My grandpa knew John Hammond.

851
01:14:25,778 --> 01:14:26,812
Hey.

852
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:28,857
We don't--

853
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:31,105
We don't work for Biosyn.

854
01:14:31,587 --> 01:14:32,810
I can tell.

855
01:14:33,063 --> 01:14:35,018
-We gotta get out of here.
-Yeah, we should go.

856
01:14:51,216 --> 01:14:53,911
Okay, in and out.
We find your girl and go.

857
01:14:55,205 --> 01:14:58,378
Tower, this N141, request to land
for freight delivery, over.

858
01:14:58,664 --> 01:14:59,850
N141, negative,

859
01:14:59,934 --> 01:15:03,256
we've been advised you're carrying
unauthorized passengers, over.

860
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:06,620
<i>Copy that, Tower, be advised,
shipment is perishable.</i>

861
01:15:06,704 --> 01:15:09,021
<i>We need immediate clearance.
It's an emergency, over.</i>

862
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:10,456
But we said "no."

863
01:15:11,311 --> 01:15:13,519
Negative, return to point of origin.

864
01:15:13,603 --> 01:15:16,208
You seem to be breaking up.
Are you hearing me on your side?

865
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:20,710
Nice try, Kayla. They will down your bird.

866
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:24,136
Who is this? Is this Denise?

867
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,348
<i>You do not want me
to start spilling secrets, Denise.</i>

868
01:15:26,432 --> 01:15:28,054
<i>You remember Dubrovnik?</i>

869
01:15:30,444 --> 01:15:34,108
It's a different Denise. In accounts.

870
01:15:41,825 --> 01:15:43,062
Talked to Santos.

871
01:15:43,749 --> 01:15:45,111
It's the girl's parents.

872
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:49,883
Shut off the ADS.

873
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:51,263
You sure?

874
01:16:00,506 --> 01:16:01,854
What's that?

875
01:16:03,036 --> 01:16:05,431
That's the Aerial Deterrent System.

876
01:16:05,632 --> 01:16:07,027
Keeps the airborne life away.

877
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,151
Why is it blinking?

878
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:10,354
Because deadass Denise
in the Tower just turned it off.

879
01:16:10,438 --> 01:16:12,221
We gotta get out
of this airspace right now.

880
01:16:16,938 --> 01:16:18,468
That's another plane, right?

881
01:16:18,552 --> 01:16:19,733
Not exactly.

882
01:16:23,436 --> 01:16:25,566
-Is that a..?
-Quetzalcoatlus.

883
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,909
Late Cretaceous, should've stayed there.

884
01:16:34,571 --> 01:16:36,656
Okay, okay.

885
01:16:37,337 --> 01:16:38,959
It's cool. We're good. It's gone.

886
01:16:56,154 --> 01:16:58,099
This plane in going down.

887
01:16:58,183 --> 01:17:00,828
If you're gonna eject
you need to do it now.

888
01:17:00,912 --> 01:17:02,770
I only got one chair, she's in it.

889
01:17:02,858 --> 01:17:06,005
-You don't have parachutes?
-I wasn't expecting company.

890
01:17:13,807 --> 01:17:16,543
Claire, we gotta get you off this plane.

891
01:17:16,627 --> 01:17:17,481
What?

892
01:17:17,565 --> 01:17:19,622
The parachute is gonna open automatically.

893
01:17:19,706 --> 01:17:22,465
If it doesn't you pull this lever.
Do you understand me?

894
01:17:22,549 --> 01:17:24,954
Claire! If it doesn't open automatically

895
01:17:25,038 --> 01:17:27,104
you gotta pull this lever here
behind you, okay?

896
01:17:27,188 --> 01:17:28,533
Ten thousand feet!

897
01:17:28,617 --> 01:17:30,716
Hey! You're the one
who's gotta go get to her.

898
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,882
You're her mom. You're her only shot.

899
01:17:35,867 --> 01:17:37,129
I'll see you again.

900
01:17:38,924 --> 01:17:40,062
I love you.

901
01:18:29,825 --> 01:18:30,870
What's the plan?

902
01:18:30,954 --> 01:18:33,672
Whatever happens - that's the plan.

903
01:18:48,219 --> 01:18:49,127
Three.

904
01:18:50,331 --> 01:18:51,895
Alan, we need the code.

905
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:53,147
Let's try this thing.

906
01:18:53,374 --> 01:18:54,373
Yeah.

907
01:18:54,934 --> 01:18:56,281
Get down.

908
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:03,541
Thank God, it's you.

909
01:19:04,236 --> 01:19:06,036
This place is such a maze.

910
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:08,333
We were so confused.
I thought we were straight up lost

911
01:19:08,417 --> 01:19:10,698
Then you said Station 3.
And I was like, we thought--

912
01:19:10,782 --> 01:19:11,977
Do you have the sample?

913
01:19:12,512 --> 01:19:13,916
-What?
-What are you talking about?

914
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,608
The DNA sample, do you have it?

915
01:19:16,269 --> 01:19:18,308
Biosyn's responsible
for the locusts epidemic.

916
01:19:18,392 --> 01:19:19,399
Dodgson's covering it up.

917
01:19:19,483 --> 01:19:21,522
You were right. I'm here to help you.

918
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:23,493
Do you have it?

919
01:19:25,892 --> 01:19:26,753
Good.

920
01:19:27,243 --> 01:19:29,169
This pod will take you
straight to the airfield.

921
01:19:29,253 --> 01:19:30,496
We have a plane ready to fly.

922
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:32,682
Ian told you about Hexapod Allies?

923
01:19:32,766 --> 01:19:34,475
No, I told him.

924
01:19:34,559 --> 01:19:35,422
What?

925
01:19:36,489 --> 01:19:38,180
-Okay, guys, gotta go.
-Wait.

926
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:44,503
Maisie.

927
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:48,706
Maisie Lockwood.

928
01:19:51,986 --> 01:19:52,856
Go.

929
01:24:07,865 --> 01:24:09,420
That was my baby.

930
01:24:18,001 --> 01:24:19,248
Where'd you learn to fly?

931
01:24:20,596 --> 01:24:21,871
Air Force.

932
01:24:22,059 --> 01:24:23,699
Legacy on my mama side.

933
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,326
I'm Navy.

934
01:24:25,795 --> 01:24:27,610
Okay, so how'd you end up doing this?

935
01:24:28,261 --> 01:24:30,410
I was a legit contract pilot for a grip,

936
01:24:30,494 --> 01:24:33,007
but didn't exactly pay enough
to be out here sending money home,**

937
01:24:33,091 --> 01:24:35,638
so I hit up a few contacts
for the more lucrative shady shit.

938
01:24:37,767 --> 01:24:40,191
Honestly, I might be done
with this line of work.

939
01:24:40,525 --> 01:24:41,926
Is that why you're helping us?

940
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:47,613
I was there when they handed
your girl off to Biosyn.

941
01:24:49,274 --> 01:24:52,486
I could've said something, but I didn't.

942
01:24:52,803 --> 01:24:54,234
And when I saw her picture...

943
01:24:57,077 --> 01:24:59,773
It isn't enough to do nothing.

944
01:25:04,284 --> 01:25:05,287
Thank you.

945
01:25:52,286 --> 01:25:53,528
No.

946
01:25:58,094 --> 01:25:58,977
Nope.

947
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:24,670
What an asshole.

948
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:16,997
You good?

949
01:27:17,785 --> 01:27:19,356
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

950
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,735
I'm not shook at all. Are you?

951
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:22,277
No. No.

952
01:27:24,932 --> 01:27:27,281
Ejection seat beacon. We'll find her.

953
01:27:27,395 --> 01:27:28,724
Okay. Okay.

954
01:27:29,389 --> 01:27:30,989
You really love her, huh?

955
01:27:32,725 --> 01:27:33,573
Yeah.

956
01:27:34,463 --> 01:27:35,454
I get it.

957
01:27:36,956 --> 01:27:38,537
I like redheads too.

958
01:27:39,967 --> 01:27:41,249
What? God.

959
01:27:45,305 --> 01:27:47,912
-Who is that?
-That's Grant and Sattler.

960
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:50,212
-Is this live?
-Twelve minutes ago.

961
01:27:50,296 --> 01:27:52,909
We were tracking the escaped asset.
My guys missed it.

962
01:27:53,623 --> 01:27:55,391
They stole a DNA sample.

963
01:27:55,845 --> 01:27:58,240
-How did they get in there?
-They used an access key.

964
01:27:58,324 --> 01:27:59,603
Yankee white clearance.

965
01:28:00,951 --> 01:28:04,393
One of our cameras saw Ian Malcolm
put something in Sattler's pocket.

966
01:28:06,617 --> 01:28:08,501
All right. I wanna see him.

967
01:28:08,586 --> 01:28:10,290
And get Ramsay up here too, will you?

968
01:28:11,838 --> 01:28:12,792
Where are they now?

969
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:14,473
On the way to the airfield.

970
01:28:14,557 --> 01:28:16,505
They caught a hyperloop right on schedule.

971
01:28:22,683 --> 01:28:23,765
How are you?

972
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:26,291
You all right?

973
01:28:27,695 --> 01:28:29,343
Not really, no.

974
01:28:31,328 --> 01:28:32,188
Hey.

975
01:28:33,096 --> 01:28:35,347
I knew your mom.

976
01:28:39,525 --> 01:28:41,088
You did?

977
01:28:43,013 --> 01:28:45,948
Yeah, few years after Hammond died

978
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:49,407
she came to my university to lecture.

979
01:28:51,107 --> 01:28:52,467
And we became good friends.

980
01:28:53,075 --> 01:28:54,472
What was she like?

981
01:28:54,989 --> 01:28:56,127
Brilliant.

982
01:28:56,218 --> 01:28:58,114
Light-years ahead of everybody else.

983
01:28:59,445 --> 01:29:00,934
And she had a consciousness.

984
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:04,259
When they were building theme parks

985
01:29:04,376 --> 01:29:07,690
she was determined to prove
that genetic power could save lives.

986
01:29:09,157 --> 01:29:11,662
-And I was her experiment?
-No.

987
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,358
She wanted a child more than anything.

988
01:29:17,453 --> 01:29:20,045
But she wanted you to have
what she couldn't,

989
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:22,557
a full life.

990
01:29:25,896 --> 01:29:27,615
I didn't know her long,

991
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,611
but I know she loved you very much.

992
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,605
What's happening?

993
01:29:57,959 --> 01:29:59,780
This must be the old amber mines.

994
01:30:01,406 --> 01:30:04,398
They must've made access doors
when they built these tunnels.

995
01:30:29,836 --> 01:30:31,006
Hey.

996
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:32,678
I heard the alarm. Everything all right?

997
01:30:32,763 --> 01:30:35,471
Yeah, nothing we can't handle.

998
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:36,577
Listen...

999
01:30:36,661 --> 01:30:37,498
You rang?

1000
01:30:37,582 --> 01:30:39,739
Oh, good, Dr. Malcolm, you are

1001
01:30:40,672 --> 01:30:41,687
fired.

1002
01:30:42,459 --> 01:30:43,562
What?

1003
01:30:43,646 --> 01:30:46,566
It was such a cushy gig.

1004
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:50,585
You can give your access key
to security if you still have it.

1005
01:30:50,668 --> 01:30:53,534
One of the hyperloop pods
just shut down in the amber mines.

1006
01:30:53,618 --> 01:30:54,488
What?

1007
01:30:55,242 --> 01:30:57,580
Wow, this day.

1008
01:30:58,099 --> 01:30:59,583
Which pod?

1009
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:00,625
Are there...

1010
01:31:02,094 --> 01:31:03,585
dinosaurs in the mines?

1011
01:31:03,669 --> 01:31:05,293
There are dinosaurs everywhere.

1012
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:07,596
Technically birds are dinosaurs,
genetically speaking.

1013
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:11,290
Lewis, Grant and Sattler are on this pod.
We need to send a security team out there.

1014
01:31:11,374 --> 01:31:13,137
Okay, absolutely, Ramsay, thank you.

1015
01:31:13,221 --> 01:31:14,912
Let's all just stay in our lanes though.

1016
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:17,598
We can take care of it.
Thank you, Doctor.

1017
01:31:17,682 --> 01:31:20,209
That's it, huh? Nothing else to see here?

1018
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:24,100
I'm not sure I admire your tone right now.

1019
01:31:24,207 --> 01:31:25,668
-You need to leave.
-Yeah, I do.

1020
01:31:25,752 --> 01:31:27,205
But first...

1021
01:31:27,289 --> 01:31:29,152
I owe all these folks an apology.

1022
01:31:29,236 --> 01:31:32,001
I think that by lending my cachet
to this joint

1023
01:31:32,085 --> 01:31:34,983
I might have made it seem
as if Biosyn wasn't rotten to the core.

1024
01:31:35,067 --> 01:31:37,252
-That's enough, Ian.
-See, that's how they get ya.

1025
01:31:37,338 --> 01:31:39,830
They give you so many promotions
in the short period of time.

1026
01:31:39,914 --> 01:31:42,070
that it bludgeons your capacity
for critical thinking.

1027
01:31:42,154 --> 01:31:42,988
Oh, my God.

1028
01:31:43,072 --> 01:31:45,110
So, then there are doors
that you don't open.

1029
01:31:45,194 --> 01:31:46,387
Things that you ignore.

1030
01:31:46,471 --> 01:31:49,935
But mainly, he's exploiting
your enchantment

1031
01:31:50,963 --> 01:31:51,815
with these.

1032
01:31:51,899 --> 01:31:54,217
Is there an actual concern here?
Or you just--

1033
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:56,917
You are racing toward the extinction
of our species,

1034
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:58,328
and you don't care.

1035
01:31:58,412 --> 01:32:01,569
You know exactly what you're doing.
But you won't stop.

1036
01:32:01,653 --> 01:32:02,645
You can't.

1037
01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:06,384
I thought you might be different,
but you just like everyone else.

1038
01:32:06,468 --> 01:32:07,571
You see what you wanna see.

1039
01:32:07,959 --> 01:32:12,245
You imagine unchecked avarice,
so that's what you find.

1040
01:32:12,329 --> 01:32:17,191
You envision what, an evil unbound
Prometheus, so that what I am to you?

1041
01:32:17,275 --> 01:32:18,765
Prometheus got gored.

1042
01:32:18,850 --> 01:32:21,681
So will you, you rapacious rat bastard.

1043
01:32:21,765 --> 01:32:25,563
Ramsay, would you help
Dr. Malcolm gather his things?

1044
01:32:26,498 --> 01:32:28,660
His room and then to the airfield.
That's it.

1045
01:32:38,693 --> 01:32:39,787
Dodgson.

1046
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,931
Allosaurus?

1047
01:34:16,318 --> 01:34:17,562
Giganotosaurus.

1048
01:34:18,416 --> 01:34:20,125
Largest known terrestrial carnivore.

1049
01:34:20,929 --> 01:34:23,247
He put two apex predators in one valley.

1050
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:25,172
Pretty soon there's only gonna be one.

1051
01:34:57,434 --> 01:34:58,598
Did you feel that?

1052
01:35:00,418 --> 01:35:01,823
That's an air current.

1053
01:35:02,351 --> 01:35:03,819
Must be an opening up ahead.

1054
01:35:05,249 --> 01:35:06,848
How old is this mine do you think?

1055
01:35:07,558 --> 01:35:08,686
Just breathe.

1056
01:35:09,474 --> 01:35:11,527
Nobody panic. Just watch out for bats.

1057
01:35:11,617 --> 01:35:13,415
-Who said anything about bats?
-I hate bats.

1058
01:35:13,523 --> 01:35:15,967
There's probably no bats.
No falling rocks.

1059
01:35:16,849 --> 01:35:19,793
Just a possibility of toxic gas,
dehydration, hypothermia.

1060
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,147
Just possibilities, nothing for certain.

1061
01:35:22,231 --> 01:35:25,188
I should've left you where you were.
Why did I bring you into this?

1062
01:35:25,272 --> 01:35:26,786
You were happy in your element.

1063
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:27,704
What?

1064
01:35:27,788 --> 01:35:29,066
-Ellie.
-What?

1065
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,141
I wasn't happy.

1066
01:35:32,979 --> 01:35:33,863
You weren't?

1067
01:35:33,947 --> 01:35:35,162
Do you have kids?

1068
01:35:35,694 --> 01:35:36,562
What?

1069
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:40,271
No. I do. Two.

1070
01:35:41,171 --> 01:35:42,232
But not with him?

1071
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:46,646
No.

1072
01:35:47,387 --> 01:35:49,651
No, just old friends.

1073
01:35:50,192 --> 01:35:52,161
Yeah, just old friends.

1074
01:35:53,382 --> 01:35:54,356
Really?

1075
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:01,478
Won't be long
before security knows you're gone.

1076
01:36:02,233 --> 01:36:05,188
Oh, map. That looks like an old map.
Do you have a new map?

1077
01:36:05,272 --> 01:36:07,770
There's an access gate
to the north-east corner of the mine.

1078
01:36:07,854 --> 01:36:09,372
-If your friends make it out.
-If?

1079
01:36:09,965 --> 01:36:12,075
When they make it out,
that's where they'll be.

1080
01:36:13,321 --> 01:36:15,155
These roads are protected, right?

1081
01:36:15,955 --> 01:36:17,023
Yeah, drive fast.

1082
01:36:28,664 --> 01:36:29,761
You did good.

1083
01:36:30,273 --> 01:36:33,372
Yeah, well... Actually,
it's a complete disaster, but thanks.

1084
01:36:34,367 --> 01:36:35,281
Not yet.

1085
01:36:46,645 --> 01:36:47,679
Watch yourself.

1086
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:08,518
-Ellie.
-Yeah.

1087
01:37:13,873 --> 01:37:14,851
What was that?

1088
01:37:22,258 --> 01:37:23,259
Careful.

1089
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:39,268
-Oh, my God!
-Are you okay?

1090
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:59,141
Forget the hat!

1091
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:02,105
Come on!

1092
01:38:11,794 --> 01:38:12,862
Go, go!

1093
01:38:18,646 --> 01:38:19,980
It's a car.

1094
01:38:21,704 --> 01:38:23,501
-God, Ian!
-In here! Over here.

1095
01:38:24,796 --> 01:38:25,833
-In here!
-Come on, Ian!

1096
01:38:25,917 --> 01:38:27,859
-Open the gate!
-Please help us.

1097
01:38:28,707 --> 01:38:29,936
-Do you know the code?

1098
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:31,745
I didn't know there was gonna be a code.

1099
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:34,581
I didn't know there was gonna be a code.

1100
01:38:35,508 --> 01:38:37,124
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1101
01:38:38,725 --> 01:38:40,563
The brake, pull the break!

1102
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:41,799
There's 10,000 possibilities.

1103
01:38:41,883 --> 01:38:43,266
Push with your legs! That's it.

1104
01:38:44,908 --> 01:38:47,366
-1984.
-Come on, Ian!

1105
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:49,906
-Here come again!
-Hurry!

1106
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:53,063
Miles Davis' birthday, 0526.

1107
01:38:58,376 --> 01:39:00,909
-Ian, do something!
-Please, please!

1108
01:39:00,993 --> 01:39:02,260
We're not gonna make it.

1109
01:39:02,344 --> 01:39:04,301
Let's all try and stay positive.

1110
01:39:20,654 --> 01:39:23,673
-Please.
-I know. I know.

1111
01:39:30,296 --> 01:39:31,356
Oh, my God!

1112
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:35,092
What do you know,
it actually worked.

1113
01:39:41,054 --> 01:39:43,315
-Ian, this is Maisie.
-Hi, Maisie.

1114
01:39:43,881 --> 01:39:45,423
We got the DNA.

1115
01:39:46,667 --> 01:39:48,181
We need to get out of this valley.

1116
01:39:48,265 --> 01:39:50,385
-Yeah, let's go.
-Come on.

1117
01:40:21,703 --> 01:40:23,236
Come on, come on.

1118
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:34,501
Go on! Get.

1119
01:41:37,903 --> 01:41:38,830
Hey.

1120
01:41:38,914 --> 01:41:39,821
Oh, my God.

1121
01:41:41,684 --> 01:41:42,979
I thought you were dead.

1122
01:41:43,063 --> 01:41:44,220
What do they even eat?

1123
01:41:49,432 --> 01:41:50,933
We better get inside.

1124
01:42:05,206 --> 01:42:06,435
LOCUST PLAGUE JUMPS CONTINENTS

1125
01:42:06,519 --> 01:42:07,716
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?

1126
01:42:32,011 --> 01:42:33,364
Go ahead.

1127
01:43:12,723 --> 01:43:14,571
<i>Containment chamber is compromised.</i>

1128
01:43:30,659 --> 01:43:31,789
It's locked.

1129
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:34,205
That'll need something heavy,
something sharp, or both.

1130
01:43:45,965 --> 01:43:48,436
That can't be right.

1131
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:02,053
-Is that..?
-Oh, no.

1132
01:44:02,453 --> 01:44:03,748
Oh, my God.

1133
01:44:06,383 --> 01:44:07,843
He's burning the evidence.

1134
01:44:09,031 --> 01:44:10,518
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1135
01:44:10,603 --> 01:44:11,960
That's bananas.

1136
01:44:28,466 --> 01:44:29,507
Yeah.

1137
01:44:30,131 --> 01:44:31,134
Oh, my God.

1138
01:44:31,663 --> 01:44:35,546
I know how this may seem
precarious, but...

1139
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:39,132
No, we're teetering.

1140
01:44:41,337 --> 01:44:43,674
Should we all
lean to the left or something?

1141
01:44:43,758 --> 01:44:45,680
That's a very constructive.
Thank you, Maisie.

1142
01:44:47,313 --> 01:44:49,242
Slow. Slow.

1143
01:44:51,496 --> 01:44:52,497
Slow.

1144
01:44:56,606 --> 01:44:57,662
We're fine.

1145
01:44:58,189 --> 01:44:59,417
See this?

1146
01:45:00,339 --> 01:45:01,554
This is fine.

1147
01:45:15,836 --> 01:45:18,164
Alan? Alan!

1148
01:45:19,566 --> 01:45:20,714
How's everybody?

1149
01:45:31,067 --> 01:45:34,664
It's my parents! Help!

1150
01:45:35,375 --> 01:45:36,407
Help!

1151
01:45:36,498 --> 01:45:37,470
Listen.

1152
01:45:45,379 --> 01:45:46,443
Oh, my God!

1153
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:48,347
You're okay.

1154
01:45:49,481 --> 01:45:50,443
You're okay.

1155
01:45:50,957 --> 01:45:53,663
You came to get me.
You actually came to get me.

1156
01:45:53,909 --> 01:45:56,121
Of course we did, sweetheart.

1157
01:45:56,205 --> 01:45:58,060
-Hey, kiddo.
-Of course.

1158
01:46:00,034 --> 01:46:01,548
I remember you.

1159
01:46:03,176 --> 01:46:04,538
I remember you too.

1160
01:46:15,378 --> 01:46:16,747
They helped me escape.

1161
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:23,484
You okay?

1162
01:46:26,289 --> 01:46:27,557
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1163
01:46:30,352 --> 01:46:31,767
We gotta go.

1164
01:46:32,475 --> 01:46:34,849
Gonna have to break the window
to get inside that thing.

1165
01:46:35,817 --> 01:46:37,574
Hope nobody's afraid of heights.

1166
01:46:50,576 --> 01:46:52,595
-Don't move.
-Don't move.

1167
01:47:10,846 --> 01:47:12,113
What is that?

1168
01:47:12,795 --> 01:47:14,449
Giganotosaurus.

1169
01:47:16,633 --> 01:47:18,604
Biggest carnivore the world has ever seen.

1170
01:47:31,584 --> 01:47:32,550
Come on.

1171
01:47:37,818 --> 01:47:39,881
Maisie, look at me. Look at me.

1172
01:48:03,622 --> 01:48:04,515
Move.

1173
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:21,873
-Go, go.
-Come on!

1174
01:48:27,741 --> 01:48:28,811
No, no!

1175
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:35,239
-Hustle.
-I'm gonna die!

1176
01:48:35,577 --> 01:48:36,694
Climb. Climb, kid.

1177
01:48:36,778 --> 01:48:38,702
You're not. No, you're not. You're okay.

1178
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:48,988
Go, go!

1179
01:49:06,829 --> 01:49:08,118
Come on.

1180
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:10,541
Hey!

1181
01:49:17,526 --> 01:49:19,061
Oh, yeah, come here.

1182
01:49:36,795 --> 01:49:37,752
Hit me up.

1183
01:49:43,266 --> 01:49:44,288
I got ya.

1184
01:49:47,085 --> 01:49:48,326
Go, go!

1185
01:49:51,903 --> 01:49:52,774
Run!

1186
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:10,948
See, not so bad.

1187
01:50:17,602 --> 01:50:18,490
Come on.

1188
01:50:20,998 --> 01:50:22,073
Claire!

1189
01:51:04,805 --> 01:51:06,280
Call in evacuation.

1190
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:07,978
We need to bring the animals inside.

1191
01:51:08,062 --> 01:51:10,988
The regulations are clear
that in the event of a level--

1192
01:51:14,111 --> 01:51:15,002
Jeffrey.

1193
01:51:20,489 --> 01:51:22,982
Goddamnit!

1194
01:51:25,786 --> 01:51:26,620
Just...

1195
01:51:28,369 --> 01:51:29,457
Just call it.

1196
01:51:30,265 --> 01:51:33,935
Attention! Attention!
This is an immediate evacuation order.

1197
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:35,933
Remote herding system is now active.

1198
01:51:36,051 --> 01:51:39,550
All living assets en route
to emergency containment.

1199
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:06,394
I can't get hold of anybody
since everything is on fire.

1200
01:52:06,891 --> 01:52:09,258
-Dr. Sattler, get some water.
-Thanks.

1201
01:52:09,342 --> 01:52:11,557
Dr. Grant, yours.

1202
01:52:11,641 --> 01:52:13,129
I'm Owen Grady.

1203
01:52:13,213 --> 01:52:16,547
Big fan, I've read your book.
Well, book on tape.

1204
01:52:16,634 --> 01:52:18,964
Owen Grady. Owen Grady.

1205
01:52:19,049 --> 01:52:20,436
Yeah, I know who you are.

1206
01:52:21,244 --> 01:52:23,477
You trained Raptors.

1207
01:52:24,021 --> 01:52:25,836
I tried. Yeah.

1208
01:52:26,191 --> 01:52:28,843
-How are you doing?
-One here.

1209
01:52:29,423 --> 01:52:31,820
You were at Jurassic World.

1210
01:52:31,904 --> 01:52:33,169
Jurassic World?

1211
01:52:33,516 --> 01:52:34,663
Not a fan.

1212
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:39,562
Okay, so, we're good
to find a way outta here?

1213
01:52:39,653 --> 01:52:40,539
Yep.

1214
01:52:40,623 --> 01:52:42,013
Let's get it.

1215
01:52:42,098 --> 01:52:45,302
There's a helicopter
out in the main complex.

1216
01:52:45,386 --> 01:52:47,939
We turn the ADS back on, we go home.

1217
01:52:48,023 --> 01:52:49,492
Wait, what's an ADS?

1218
01:52:49,625 --> 01:52:50,933
Aerial deterrent system.

1219
01:52:52,348 --> 01:52:56,288
You know, for the pterodactyls and shit.
Keeps them away from the helicopters.

1220
01:52:57,090 --> 01:52:58,536
How do we turn it back on?

1221
01:52:58,620 --> 01:53:01,356
Okay, it looks like all the systems
run through the control room

1222
01:53:01,463 --> 01:53:02,800
which is on the third floor,

1223
01:53:04,222 --> 01:53:06,496
And these outposts
are all connected underground.

1224
01:53:12,017 --> 01:53:13,034
All right, easy, Rambo.

1225
01:53:23,966 --> 01:53:26,023
So, you worked in the Raptor pan, huh?

1226
01:53:26,691 --> 01:53:27,896
Yeah.

1227
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:32,849
Wow, and what happens, you just tell them
what to do and they comply or...

1228
01:53:33,977 --> 01:53:37,672
Well, that's a human-animal bond
based on mutual respect.

1229
01:53:40,139 --> 01:53:41,560
I had a dog once.

1230
01:53:42,528 --> 01:53:46,806
Humped my leg so much
I got a callus on my shinbone.

1231
01:53:47,403 --> 01:53:48,617
It's a true story.

1232
01:54:01,907 --> 01:54:03,403
Oh, God. Hey.

1233
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:04,757
Good.

1234
01:54:06,439 --> 01:54:07,813
Here's what I'm thinking.

1235
01:54:07,910 --> 01:54:09,941
We get started again, you and me.

1236
01:54:10,356 --> 01:54:11,724
I can get money.

1237
01:54:13,079 --> 01:54:15,269
Yeah. Money's cheap these days.

1238
01:54:15,362 --> 01:54:17,685
What's the matter? Don't look so worried.

1239
01:54:18,531 --> 01:54:21,631
There's opportunity in everything,
even this.

1240
01:54:21,718 --> 01:54:23,349
You'll learn that.

1241
01:54:23,433 --> 01:54:24,550
I've been thinking...

1242
01:54:25,385 --> 01:54:27,534
Maybe you take more
of a lead now, okay?

1243
01:54:28,121 --> 01:54:29,243
You're ready I think.

1244
01:54:29,716 --> 01:54:31,258
Here. Take it.

1245
01:54:31,691 --> 01:54:33,387
What the hell is the matter with you?

1246
01:54:42,739 --> 01:54:43,936
It was you.

1247
01:54:44,571 --> 01:54:46,839
You told Malcolm about the program. You...

1248
01:54:48,052 --> 01:54:50,826
You set this whole thing up.
You set me up?

1249
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:53,953
I gave you every opportunity
I did not have. I...

1250
01:54:55,621 --> 01:54:57,984
We have an understanding, Ramsay,

1251
01:54:58,605 --> 01:55:00,133
and you do not break that.

1252
01:55:03,007 --> 01:55:04,842
I would not break this.

1253
01:55:07,997 --> 01:55:08,958
I'm not you.

1254
01:55:24,445 --> 01:55:25,743
This is very bad.

1255
01:55:27,957 --> 01:55:30,244
This is the same system
we used at the park.

1256
01:55:30,328 --> 01:55:34,952
Great, so we can turn on the thing
and then we all get out of here?

1257
01:55:35,036 --> 01:55:36,697
Let me see. ADS

1258
01:55:37,864 --> 01:55:39,922
What's this? What's "Error 99"?

1259
01:55:40,006 --> 01:55:41,040
Not enough power.

1260
01:55:41,878 --> 01:55:43,336
In a breakdown all available power

1261
01:55:43,427 --> 01:55:45,375
is seized by the primary system
to keep running.

1262
01:55:45,935 --> 01:55:48,032
We need all that power
to re-activate the ADS.

1263
01:55:48,116 --> 01:55:50,902
So, the system safety feature
is what's gonna kill us?

1264
01:55:50,986 --> 01:55:51,853
Of course.

1265
01:55:51,937 --> 01:55:53,134
How do we get more power?

1266
01:55:53,218 --> 01:55:55,664
We can't. But we can re-distribute
what we have, if we just...

1267
01:55:55,748 --> 01:55:57,653
-Just need to--
-Shut down the primary system.

1268
01:55:57,737 --> 01:55:59,234
-Yes, exactly.
-Where is it?

1269
01:55:59,319 --> 01:56:01,203
-Next floor up.
-I'm coming with you.

1270
01:56:01,294 --> 01:56:02,551
We escaped down here.

1271
01:56:03,892 --> 01:56:05,391
Where is that? Water Treatment Center.

1272
01:56:05,475 --> 01:56:07,111
Hydroelectric system, Sub 8.

1273
01:56:07,195 --> 01:56:08,934
Give me eight minutes, I could find her.

1274
01:56:09,018 --> 01:56:10,989
-Wait, who's this now?
-Beta.

1275
01:56:11,730 --> 01:56:13,638
-Blue's baby.
-Velociraptor.

1276
01:56:14,171 --> 01:56:15,926
-What?
-A baby Raptor?

1277
01:56:16,010 --> 01:56:17,789
And you gave her a name, how about that.

1278
01:56:17,873 --> 01:56:19,518
I made a promise we would bring her home.

1279
01:56:19,602 --> 01:56:21,803
You made a promise to a dinosaur.

1280
01:56:22,623 --> 01:56:23,918
You're coming with us, right?

1281
01:56:24,738 --> 01:56:25,655
Maisie...

1282
01:56:25,739 --> 01:56:26,714
Please.

1283
01:56:30,154 --> 01:56:32,113
-We'll be on channel 5.
-Okay.

1284
01:56:32,197 --> 01:56:33,134
We're on 3.

1285
01:56:34,956 --> 01:56:35,872
Come back.

1286
01:56:36,674 --> 01:56:37,901
I always come back.

1287
01:56:39,319 --> 01:56:42,141
I'll have that chopper hot in ten,
wait for my signal.

1288
01:56:44,022 --> 01:56:48,519
<i>Evacuation Phase Four complete.
All living assets are now in containment.</i>

1289
01:56:57,434 --> 01:56:58,447
Come on.

1290
01:57:11,069 --> 01:57:12,363
Still get nightmares?

1291
01:57:13,073 --> 01:57:14,197
All of the time.

1292
01:57:15,104 --> 01:57:15,946
You?

1293
01:57:17,367 --> 01:57:18,768
I have a lot of regrets.

1294
01:57:19,483 --> 01:57:20,471
Oh, yeah?

1295
01:57:22,041 --> 01:57:22,905
Well...

1296
01:57:23,953 --> 01:57:26,909
We hold on to regret we stay in the past.

1297
01:57:30,609 --> 01:57:32,562
What matters, I guess, is...

1298
01:57:34,094 --> 01:57:36,504
Is what we do now, right?

1299
01:57:37,231 --> 01:57:38,259
Yeah.

1300
01:57:55,402 --> 01:57:57,242
Nobody said there'll be bugs.

1301
01:57:59,496 --> 01:58:01,598
B4. She's in here.

1302
01:58:02,285 --> 01:58:03,817
Watch the sides.

1303
01:58:04,370 --> 01:58:06,072
They always come from the sides.

1304
01:58:08,251 --> 01:58:09,536
You know, at first we thought...

1305
01:58:11,289 --> 01:58:14,386
they disembowel their prey, but now...

1306
01:58:15,258 --> 01:58:17,560
They're smart enough
to go straight to the throat.

1307
01:58:18,729 --> 01:58:20,366
Veins, the arteries.

1308
01:58:21,523 --> 01:58:23,621
Sometimes both at the same time.

1309
01:58:23,715 --> 01:58:24,856
Okay.

1310
01:58:26,642 --> 01:58:27,799
Okay.

1311
01:58:27,883 --> 01:58:29,961
<i>We've got you. It's right down that isle.</i>

1312
01:58:30,045 --> 01:58:31,727
<i>It's right down that isle where you are.</i>

1313
01:58:32,798 --> 01:58:35,644
Why are they skulking?
You can sprint right for it.

1314
01:58:35,728 --> 01:58:37,561
Okay. Here it is.

1315
01:58:37,645 --> 01:58:40,128
Okay, it'll be a yellow button
on the grid of six.

1316
01:58:40,212 --> 01:58:42,952
<i>There's a green button.
Do you see a green button?</i>

1317
01:58:43,042 --> 01:58:46,016
It's not the green button,
it's fourth from the bottom.

1318
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:47,460
Whoa, whoa...

1319
01:58:47,544 --> 01:58:48,407
Fourth one up?

1320
01:58:48,492 --> 01:58:50,193
Third one down or fourth one up.
Same thing.

1321
01:58:50,277 --> 01:58:51,681
Ian, be specific.

1322
01:58:56,726 --> 01:58:57,707
She was here.

1323
01:58:58,528 --> 01:58:59,576
Lights off.

1324
01:59:06,305 --> 01:59:08,606
I don't know how I could possibly
be more specific

1325
01:59:08,690 --> 01:59:13,104
other than to say that the one you want
is marked with E1.

1326
01:59:15,096 --> 01:59:15,977
-E1.
-Okay.

1327
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:17,798
Yeah.

1328
01:59:22,968 --> 01:59:25,176
No. No, no.

1329
01:59:31,726 --> 01:59:33,034
Dammit, she's fast.

1330
01:59:36,705 --> 01:59:37,587
Hey!

1331
01:59:38,761 --> 01:59:39,916
Eyes on me!

1332
01:59:44,349 --> 01:59:46,597
I've gotta hit her
on the side of the neck.

1333
01:59:46,681 --> 01:59:48,662
Maisie, you gonna hold her focused.

1334
01:59:49,173 --> 01:59:51,716
Grant, we're triangulating.

1335
01:59:58,225 --> 01:59:59,228
Go.

1336
02:00:28,499 --> 02:00:29,510
Sorry, girl.

1337
02:00:30,398 --> 02:00:32,067
I promised your mama I'd get you home.

1338
02:00:33,547 --> 02:00:35,792
<i>Primary system rebooting.</i>

1339
02:00:35,876 --> 02:00:38,317
Wait, no, no.

1340
02:00:38,401 --> 02:00:39,295
It's rebooting.

1341
02:00:39,379 --> 02:00:40,751
No, it shouldn't be doing that.

1342
02:00:52,156 --> 02:00:53,432
Here, come on, take this.

1343
02:01:09,618 --> 02:01:11,168
<i>Ian, shut it down!</i>

1344
02:01:11,252 --> 02:01:13,224
We're gonna make it work.
We gonna figure this out.

1345
02:01:13,308 --> 02:01:15,445
-It's very complex.
-We don't have time for complex!

1346
02:01:21,013 --> 02:01:22,715
<i>Primary system compromised.</i>

1347
02:01:25,234 --> 02:01:26,554
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1348
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:28,584
<i>Aerial deterrent system activate.</i>

1349
02:01:28,668 --> 02:01:30,129
Victory. Victory.

1350
02:01:33,593 --> 02:01:34,606
Damn, that felt good.

1351
02:02:04,027 --> 02:02:05,260
Come on!

1352
02:02:57,833 --> 02:02:58,840
What's your story--

1353
02:03:14,531 --> 02:03:16,977
<i>At Biosyn, we're dedicated to the idea</i>

1354
02:03:17,068 --> 02:03:20,745
<i>that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.</i>

1355
02:03:25,717 --> 02:03:28,299
<i>All right, Kayla, we're good to go.</i>

1356
02:03:38,607 --> 02:03:39,955
Okay, cutie.

1357
02:03:48,944 --> 02:03:51,119
-You all right?
-Someday.

1358
02:03:51,306 --> 02:03:52,394
Hey.

1359
02:04:00,252 --> 02:04:02,124
I remember you.

1360
02:04:02,208 --> 02:04:03,815
Please, you have to listen to me.

1361
02:04:03,899 --> 02:04:05,960
You created an ecological disaster.

1362
02:04:06,044 --> 02:04:07,249
And I can fix it.

1363
02:04:07,912 --> 02:04:11,184
Charlotte Lockwood changed every cell
in Maisie's body.

1364
02:04:12,272 --> 02:04:13,373
It saved her life.

1365
02:04:14,021 --> 02:04:17,227
If I can understand how Charlotte
rewrote Maisie's DNA

1366
02:04:17,311 --> 02:04:20,717
I can spread change from one locust
to the entire swarm

1367
02:04:20,822 --> 02:04:22,270
before it's too late.

1368
02:04:24,451 --> 02:04:26,644
It's okay. It's okay.

1369
02:04:30,813 --> 02:04:32,286
It's what she would've wanted.

1370
02:04:35,583 --> 02:04:36,687
Thank you.

1371
02:04:36,772 --> 02:04:37,980
No, no, no.

1372
02:04:38,968 --> 02:04:40,508
No, no.

1373
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:45,024
Him? Not him. Not him. It's always him.

1374
02:04:45,805 --> 02:04:46,656
Every single...

1375
02:04:48,012 --> 02:04:49,941
Is that a dinosaur on your shoulder?

1376
02:04:50,744 --> 02:04:52,107
Yeah, why?

1377
02:04:53,735 --> 02:04:55,841
<i>I have air. Meet me in the center.</i>

1378
02:04:56,314 --> 02:04:57,415
Wait, wait. Hey.

1379
02:04:58,014 --> 02:04:59,450
Do not land in here.

1380
02:04:59,534 --> 02:05:01,587
I don't have a choice, dude.
The valley isn't safe.

1381
02:05:01,671 --> 02:05:03,496
No, they're not in the valley anymore!

1382
02:06:35,562 --> 02:06:36,565
This isn't about us.

1383
02:07:08,884 --> 02:07:10,447
Get up! Come on, come on!

1384
02:07:10,580 --> 02:07:11,550
Come on.

1385
02:07:15,128 --> 02:07:16,139
Come on! Come on!

1386
02:07:21,301 --> 02:07:22,408
Come on!

1387
02:07:36,636 --> 02:07:37,930
Ellie, no!

1388
02:08:06,994 --> 02:08:08,795
Go, Maisie, go!

1389
02:08:10,324 --> 02:08:11,473
Ramsay, get on.

1390
02:08:11,557 --> 02:08:13,199
Come on, come on.

1391
02:08:18,108 --> 02:08:19,676
Everybody hold on to somebody.

1392
02:09:44,490 --> 02:09:46,272
No, at every level.

1393
02:09:46,356 --> 02:09:49,023
Complete systemic corruption
in the executive ranks.

1394
02:09:49,108 --> 02:09:51,499
"Systemic corruption", you got that?
Write that down.

1395
02:09:52,847 --> 02:09:53,943
Yeah, okay.

1396
02:09:54,077 --> 02:09:57,678
And then we clashed
into this ice lake, right?

1397
02:09:57,762 --> 02:09:59,533
I mean they literally owe me a plane.

1398
02:09:59,943 --> 02:10:02,421
I need to get this sample vetted
at the lab

1399
02:10:02,788 --> 02:10:05,024
before I take it to my contract
at the Times.

1400
02:10:07,189 --> 02:10:09,511
You coulda come with me.

1401
02:10:11,039 --> 02:10:13,757
Unless you need to get back to your dig.

1402
02:10:16,469 --> 02:10:18,139
-Ellie.
-Yeah?

1403
02:10:20,617 --> 02:10:22,307
I am coming with you.

1404
02:10:33,448 --> 02:10:34,295
I know.

1405
02:10:34,379 --> 02:10:36,864
One more minute, then we'll send you home
with your folks.

1406
02:11:16,514 --> 02:11:21,183
<i>Today marks the first day of testimony
from Biosyn whistleblower Ramsay Cole.</i>

1407
02:11:21,281 --> 02:11:24,989
<i>The Senate will also hear
from doctors Grant, Sattler and Malcolm</i>

1408
02:11:25,073 --> 02:11:28,647
<i>who have been vocal on this debate
since the incident at Jurassic Park.</i>

1409
02:11:31,405 --> 02:11:32,341
You look

1410
02:11:33,155 --> 02:11:34,624
-Untrustable.
-Trustworthy.

1411
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:42,317
Yeah, not getting used to it.

1412
02:11:44,578 --> 02:11:45,580
Let's finish this.

1413
02:11:46,517 --> 02:11:47,526
Yeah.

1414
02:11:51,721 --> 02:11:56,051
<i>Dr. Henry Wu has found an emergency
solution to the ecological crisis.</i>

1415
02:11:56,666 --> 02:11:59,884
<i>His use of a pathogen
to alter the locusts' DNA</i>

1416
02:11:59,968 --> 02:12:02,069
<i>has revolutionized modern genetics.</i>

1417
02:12:02,830 --> 02:12:06,841
<i>He attributed the discovery
to another scientist, Charlotte Lockwood,</i>

1418
02:12:06,925 --> 02:12:09,424
<i>who died nearly 13 years ago.</i>

1419
02:12:37,126 --> 02:12:42,044
<i>By UN decree Biosyn Valley
has been designated a global sanctuary.</i>

1420
02:12:42,128 --> 02:12:45,965
<i>The animals will live there free,
safe from the outside world.</i>

1421
02:12:50,545 --> 02:12:51,396
Money?

1422
02:12:51,913 --> 02:12:53,355
-Money.
-Thank you.

1423
02:14:57,104 --> 02:15:01,103
<i>Life on Earth has existed
for hundreds of millions of years.</i>

1424
02:15:02,164 --> 02:15:04,501
<i>And dinosaurs were only a part of that.</i>

1425
02:15:05,028 --> 02:15:07,223
<i>And we are an even smaller part of that.</i>

1426
02:15:07,843 --> 02:15:10,018
<i>They really put us in perspective.</i>

1427
02:15:11,898 --> 02:15:15,276
<i>The idea that life on Earth
existed 65 million years ago,</i>

1428
02:15:17,024 --> 02:15:18,196
<i>it's humbling.</i>

1429
02:15:19,599 --> 02:15:21,648
<i>We act like we're along here
but we're not.</i>

1430
02:15:22,830 --> 02:15:26,187
<i>We're a part of a fragile system
made up of all living things.</i>

1431
02:15:26,768 --> 02:15:29,898
<i>If we're going to survive
we'll have to trust each other.</i>

1432
02:15:31,018 --> 02:15:32,393
<i>Depend on each other.</i>

1433
02:15:33,635 --> 02:15:34,650
<i>Coexist.</i>
